FinOps Playbook & Decision Framework for Kubernetes
This document serves as a quick-reference guide for cost anomaly resolution and standardized decision-making within a Kubernetes cluster.
It is designed to be used by engineers, FinOps practitioners, or an AI system as an operational playbook.

1. Quick Wins Decision Tree (Rapid Savings Path)
When a cost increase or low efficiency is detected, the following diagnostic order should be applied:
Step 1 – Does the resource have ownership (labels)?
•	No:
Stop technical optimization.
Apply governance policy → enforce mandatory labeling (team, owner, env).
•	Yes:
Proceed to Step 2.
 FinOps rule:
No ownership means no optimization. Governance comes first.
________________________________________
Step 2 – Is this a critical environment (Production)?
•	No (Dev / Test / Staging):
Apply aggressive optimization strategies:
o	Spot Instances
o	scheduled shutdowns
o	reduced redundancy
•	Yes (Production):
Proceed to Step 3.
________________________________________
Step 3 – Is Slack > 50%?
•	Yes:
Execute request rightsizing, using Kubecost P95 recommendations.
•	No:
Proceed to Step 4.
________________________________________
Step 4 – Is Cluster Idle > 20%?
•	Yes:
Evaluate:
o	node consolidation
o	instance type changes (fewer larger nodes vs more smaller nodes)
o	Cluster Autoscaler configuration
•	No:
Investigate non-obvious costs (network, storage, out-of-cluster services).

2. Action Matrix – Problem → Likely Cause → Recommended Play
Observation	Likely Cause	Recommended FinOps Play
Very low CPU efficiency (<10%)	Oversized requests	Reduce requests to ~1.2× average real usage
Many almost-empty nodes	Fragmentation / poor bin-packing	Tune scheduling or Cluster Autoscaler
High network cost	Inter-AZ traffic (Multi-AZ tax)	Use topology keys to keep traffic local
High unallocated costs	Missing labels or orphaned resources	Audit orphaned PVs, disks, load balancers
Cost spikes on weekends	Dev environments always on	Implement node or namespace scheduling
 Guiding principle:
Fix the largest and simplest inefficiencies first.

3. Pre-Deployment FinOps Checklist (Shift-Left Governance)
Any new workload must pass this checklist before being considered FinOps Ready:
•	 Labels: team, app, environment, cost-center
•	 Resources: CPU and memory requests/limits explicitly defined
•	 Storage: Appropriate StorageClass (avoid Premium SSD for logs or temp data)
•	 Resilience: Can this workload run on Spot?
o	If stateless → the default answer should be Yes
•	 Scaling: HPA limits defined to avoid uncontrolled growth
📌 FinOps insight:
The cheapest optimization is preventing waste before deployment.

4. Cost Anomaly Response Policy
If Kubecost detects a daily cost increase greater than 20% for a namespace:
Step 1 – Identify the change
•	Was there a new deployment?
•	Check deployment timestamps and configuration diffs.
________________________________________
Step 2 – Analyze the cost vector
Determine whether the increase is driven by:
•	CPU / memory
•	network traffic
•	storage growth
•	out-of-cluster services
________________________________________
Step 3 – Notify ownership
•	Send an alert to the owner label
•	Include:
o	estimated monthly impact
o	top contributing resources
________________________________________
Step 4 – Justify or optimize
•	If cost increase correlates with higher traffic or user growth → mark as Justified Spend
•	If not → open an optimization task
 FinOps principle:
Not all cost increases are bad. Unexplained ones are.

5. Priority Reference Table
Use this table to decide where to invest engineering time:
High Priority
•	Oversized requests causing unnecessary node scaling
•	Idle capacity driving Cluster Autoscaler expansion
Medium Priority
•	Migrating Dev/Test workloads to Spot Instances
•	Optimizing network topology for cost
Low Priority
•	Optimizing microservices costing less than $10 USD/month
 Rule of thumb:
Engineering time is often more expensive than the infrastructure being optimized.

6. Why This Playbook Matters
This framework enables consistent, repeatable FinOps decisions by:
•	reducing emotional or ad-hoc optimization
•	aligning engineering actions with business value
•	enabling AI-driven recommendations grounded in real constraints
It allows a FinOps-aware system to say:
“This is waste. Optimize now.”
or
“This is justified spend. Do not optimize yet.”

7. Final FinOps Rule
The goal of FinOps is not to minimize cloud spend, but to ensure that every dollar spent is intentional, explainable, and aligned with business outcomes.
